PixelPowerCalculator
====================

A pixel calculator. Enter any function f(x,y) you like where indicated in the code and watch as out pops an interesting picture generated by the function.

There may be some errors in the code as I cannot upload some classes since they were straight from an MP for one of my CS classes and there may be reprecussions to making them publicly available.

Example Pictures from this generator can be found at: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0vlek6hb8hilxv6/u48dIuP_Ra

The Zen.java class was not made by me, but is used in the calculator heavily.
